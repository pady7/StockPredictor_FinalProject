Final Project for Spring batch - University of California Berkeley Extension Bootcamp


## **Ideas Brainstorming**

As a team we have brainstormed quite a few topics such as collecting the data for the H4 Visa holders who have been struggling a lot to find their EAD approvals in long queues to develop a predict data models for underdog teams in **Indian Premier League**. As the team had diversified interests and ideas based on the individual interests, we zeroed on commiting to a project that predicts the stock value of a **Green Energy** company Enphase Energy (Enph). The data points been sourced via yahoo finance and initial ideas been drawn down.

## **Project Overview**

Selected Topic - *green energy stocks*

**Overview:** 

Green energy stocks have been enormously affected since the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change on January 20, 2021. Our team selected this topic in order to analyze how the green energy stocks were affected when the US rejoined the Paris Agreement as well as to forecast its future market value. We will explore our topic through analyzing the stock trend of Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH).

## **Questions we would like to explore:**

*1. Given the data available, can we expect the ENPH price to increase or decrease in the coming years? If it increases, what is the growth rate?*

*2. Does the quarterly earnings play a determining factor in the price of the stock? Higher than historical value?*

*3. Comparative studies to another green stock by taking annual revenue, green energy ETF/stocks to give a baseline to measure.*

*4. Comparison to open versus closing values, volume per day and how it affects the price.*
