## Project Ideas

As a team we have brainstormed quite a few topics such as collecting the data for the H4 Visa holders who have been struggling a lot to find their EAD approvals in long queues to develop a predict data models for underdog teams in **Indian Premier League**. As the team had diversified interests and ideas based on the individual interests, we zeroed on commiting to a project that predicts the stock value of a **Green Energy** company Enphase Energy (Enph). The data points been sourced via yahoo finance and initial ideas been drawn down.

## Project Overview

As the need for green/renewable/solar energy is on the historical peak because of ever surging oil and gas prices in the recent past, we've decided to work on a company that has ample opportunities to spike in the coming years.
