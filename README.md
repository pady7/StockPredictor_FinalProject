# StockPredictor_FinalProject
---
Final Project for Spring batch - University of California Berkeley Extension Bootcamp

## Project Synopsis
---
The core idea of the project is to develop a model for a green energy stock.

**Data Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Emph historical stock data

## Project Ideas

As a team we have brainstormed quite a few topics such as collecting the data for the H4 Visa holders who have been struggling a lot to find their EAD approvals in long queues to develop a predict data models for underdog teams in **Indian Premier League**. As the team had diversified interests and ideas based on the individual interests, we zeroed on commiting to a project that predicts the stock value of a **Green Energy** company Enphase Energy (Enph). The data points been sourced via yahoo finance and initial ideas been drawn down.

## Project Overview
---
As the need for green/renewable/solar energy is on the historical peak because of ever surging oil and gas prices in the recent past, we've decided to work on a company that has ample opportunities to spike in the coming years. Our goal for this project is to see if we can predict future prices of the ENPH stock using machine learning. We tried modelling and testing with Linear Regression and LSTM to determine the outcome.

Machine Learning model been tested and ran thru successfully. 
Ran a different model to ensure the outcome.
